Write a Python script to create two arrays of the same shape and perform element-wise addition, 

subtraction, multiplication, and division. Calculate the dot product and cross product of two vectors.

import numpy as np

arr1 = np.array([[2, 4, 6], [8, 10, 12]])

arr2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

print("Array 1:\n", arr1)

print("\nArray 2:\n", arr2)

addition = arr1 + arr2

subtraction = arr1 - arr2

multiplication = arr1 * arr2

division = arr1 / arr2

print("\nElement-wise Addition:\n", addition)

print("\nElement-wise Subtraction:\n", subtraction)

print("\nElement-wise Multiplication:\n", multiplication)

print("\nElement-wise Division:\n", division)

vec1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])

vec2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

dot_product = np.dot(vec1, vec2)

print("\nDot Product of vec1 and vec2:", dot_product)

cross_product = np.cross(vec1, vec2)

print("Cross Product of vec1 and vec2:", cross_product)

“””Array 1:

Element-wise Multiplication:

[[ 2 8 18]

 [32 50 72]]

Element-wise Division:

Dot Product of vec1 and vec2: 32

Cross Product of vec1 and vec2: [-3 6 -3]”””

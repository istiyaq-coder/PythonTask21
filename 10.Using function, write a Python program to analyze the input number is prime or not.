#Using function, write a Python program to analyze the input number is prime or not.


INPUT:
    # Function Declaration: This is where we define the function
def is_prime(num):
    # If the number is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    # Check for divisibility from 2 to num-1
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:  # If num is divisible by any number, it's not prime
            return False
    return True  # If no divisors are found, it's prime


# Function Calling: Now, we call the function to check if the input number is prime
def main():
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Taking input from the user
    
    # Function Call: Here we're calling the is_prime function
    if is_prime(number):  # This will call the is_prime function with `number` as input
        print(f"{number} is a prime number.")
    else:
        print(f"{number} is not a prime number.")

# Calling the main function to run the program
main()
main()
main()
main()

OUTPUT:

5 is a prime number.
Enter a number: 9
9 is not a prime number.
Enter a number: 3

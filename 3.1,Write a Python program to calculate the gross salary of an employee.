Write a Python program to calculate the gross salary of an employee. The program should
prompt the user for the basic salary (BS) and then compute the dearness allowance (DA) as 70% of BS, the
travel allowance (TA) as 30% of BS, and the house rent allowance (HRA) as 10% of BS. Finally, it should
calculate the gross salary as the sum of BS, DA, TA, and HRA and display the result. Use inbuilt
mathematical function

INPUT:

import math

# Taking user input of basic salary
basic_salary = float(input("Enter the basic salary of the employee: "))

# Calculate dearness allowance (DA) as 70% of BS
dearness_allowance = 0.7 * basic_salary
print("The dearness allowance of the employee: ", dearness_allowance)

# Calculate travel allowance (TA) as 30% of BS
travel_allowance = 0.3 * basic_salary
print("The travel allowance of the employee: ", travel_allowance)

# Calculate rent allowance (HRA) as 10% of BS
house_rent_allowance = 0.1 * basic_salary
print("The house rent allowance of the employee: ", house_rent_allowance)

# Calculate the gross salary using math.fsum() for more precise summation of float numbers
gross_salary = math.fsum([basic_salary, dearness_allowance, travel_allowance, house_rent_allowance])

# Optionally, round the gross salary to two decimal places using math functions
gross_salary_rounded = round(gross_salary, 2)

print("The gross salary of the employee: ", gross_salary_rounded)

OUTPUT:
Enter the basic salary of the employee: 10000
The dearness allowance of the employee:  7000.0
The travel allowance of the employee:  3000.0
The house rent allowance of the employee:  1000.0
The gross salary of the employee:  21000.0

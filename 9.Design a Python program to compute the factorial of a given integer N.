#Design a Python program to compute the factorial of a given integer N.


METHOD 1:
    
INPUT:

# Input: Ask the user for a number
N = int(input("Enter the number: "))

# Initialize factorial to 1
factorial = 1

# Calculate factorial using a for loop
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    factorial *= i #factorial = factorial*i

# Output the result
print("The factorial is", factorial)

OUTPUT:

Enter the number: 5
The factorial is 120

METHOD 2

INPUT:

while True:
    # Input: Ask the user for a number
    N = int(input("Enter the number to compute its factorial (or type '0' to exit): "))

    # Check if the user wants to exit
    if N == 0:
        print("Exiting the program.")
        break  # Exit the loop if the user enters '0'

    # Initialize factorial to 1
    factorial = 1

    # Calculate factorial using a for loop
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        factorial *= i

    # Output the result
    print(f"The factorial of {N} is {factorial}")

OUTPUT:

The factorial of 9 is 362880
Enter the number to compute its factorial (or type '0' to exit): 0
Exiting the program.

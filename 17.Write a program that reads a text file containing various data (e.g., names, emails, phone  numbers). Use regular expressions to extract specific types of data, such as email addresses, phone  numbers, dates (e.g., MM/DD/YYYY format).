 Write a program that reads a text file containing various data (e.g., names, emails, phone 
numbers). Use regular expressions to extract specific types of data, such as email addresses, phone 
numbers, dates (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY format).
import re
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
 content = file.read()
emails = re.findall(r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}', content)
phones = re.findall(r'\b[6-9]\d{9}\b', content)
dates = re.findall(r'\b\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4}\b', content)
print("Email addresses found:")
for email in emails:
 print(email)
print("\nPhone numbers found:")
for phone in phones:
 print(phone)
print("\nDates found:")
for date in dates:
 print(date)
'''

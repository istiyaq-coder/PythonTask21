'''Write a Python program to calculate the gross salary of an
employee. The program should prompt the user for the
basic salary (BS) and then compute the dearness allowance
(DA) as 70% of BS, the travel allowance (TA) as 30% of
BS, and the house rent allowance (HRA) as 10% of BS.
Finally, it should calculate the gross salary as the sum of
BS, DA, TA, and HRA and display the result'''

INPUT :

#Taking uder input of basic salary
basic_salary = float(input("Enter the basic salary of the employee : "))

#Calculate dearness allowance of employee
daerness_allowance = 0.7*basic_salary
print("The dearness allowance of the employee",daerness_allowance)

#Calculate travel allowance of employee
travel_allowance = 0.3*basic_salary
print("The travel allowance of the employee",travel_allowance)

#Calculate rent allowance of employee
rent_allowance = 0.1*basic_salary
print("The rent allowance of the employee",rent_allowance)

#calculate the gross salary
gross_salary = basic_salary + daerness_allowance + travel_allowance + rent_allowance 

print("The gross salary of employee",gross_salary)

OUTPUT :

Enter the basic salary of the employee : 10000
The dearness allowance of the employee 7000.0
The travel allowance of the employee 3000.0
The rent allowance of the employee 1000.0
The gross salary of employee 21000.0

'''Write a Python program to explore basic arithmetic
operations. The program should prompt the user to enter
two numbers and then perform addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and modulus operations on those
numbers. The results of each operation should be displayed
to the user'''

INPUT :
    
#Taking user input 
num1 = int(input("Enter frist number : "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number : "))

#permorning addition
add = num1 + num2
print("The addition of numbers : ", add)

#permorning substraction
substract = num1 - num2
print("The substraction of numbers : ", substract)

#permorning multiplication
multipliy = num1 * num2
print("The multiplication  of numbers : ", multipliy)

#permorning division
divide = num1 / num2
print("The division of numbers : ",divide )

OUTPUT :

Enter frist number : 4
Enter second number : 2
The addition of numbers :  6
The substraction of numbers :  2
The multiplication  of numbers :  8
The division of numbers :  2.0

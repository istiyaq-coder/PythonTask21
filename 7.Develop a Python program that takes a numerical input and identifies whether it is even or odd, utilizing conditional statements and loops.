'''Develop a Pytho599n program that takes a numerical input and identifies whether it is even
or odd, utilizing conditional statements and loops.'''

METHOD 1
INPUT:

    n = int(input("Enter how many num you have to check? : "))
for i in range(n):
    num = int(input("Enter a number : "))
    even = num % 2 == 0
    if(even):
        print(f"The number {num} is even")
    else:
        print(f"The number {num} is odd")

OUTPUT:

Enter how many num you have to check? : 6
Enter a number : 3
The number 3 is odd
Enter a number : 4
The number 4 is even
Enter a number : 5
The number 5 is odd
Enter a number : 6
The number 6 is even
Enter a number : 7
The number 7 is odd
Enter a number : 9
The number 9 is odd

METHOD2
#INPUT:

while True:
    # Take a number input from the user
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    
    # Check if the number is even or odd
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"The number {num} is even")
    else:
        print(f"The number {num} is odd")
    
    # Ask the user if they want to check another number
    continue_check = input("Do you want to check another number? (yes/no): ").lower()
    
    # If the user types 'no', exit the loop
    if continue_check != "yes":
        print("Exiting the program.")
        break  # Exit the loop and stop the program
    
#OUTPUT:
Enter a number: 5
The number 5 is odd
Do you want to check another number? (yes/no): YES
Enter a number: 8
The number 8 is even
Do you want to check another number? (yes/no): yes
Enter a number: 9
The number 9 is odd
Do you want to check another number? (yes/no): no
Exiting the program.
